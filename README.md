## Introduction

Multiple Diseases Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at assisting in the early detection and prediction of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze relevant medical data and provide predictions regarding the likelihood of an individual having a particular disease.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease based on medical data.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, etc.
- Provides insights into the factors influencing disease prediction.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset containing information related to diabetes.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset containing information related to heart disease.
- `parkinsons.csv`: Dataset containing information related to Parkinson's disease.

## Models

The following machine learning models are implemented in the project:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

Trained models are saved in the `saved_models` directory.

## Usage

To use the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Access the app in your web browser using the provided URL.
5. Provide the necessary input data to get predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any ideas, feature requests, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
